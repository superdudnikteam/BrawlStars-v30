### Requirements:
- Python 3.7 or higher
- pymongo
- dnspython
- colorama

### Running the server
In a terminal, type __`pip install -r requirements.txt`__ then run the server using __`python Main.py`__

### Configuring the client app
To connect to your server, a **patched client** is required. Download this [base APK](https://mega.nz/file/XSBCHJrD#oj7KVqFRtVnsC9IZNZk0ap7Jn7yGbP0Zug4NSI8-kCA) and change the IP in `libmg.config.so`. 
### Battles
We've enabled offline battles so you can directly press "PLAY" to start a match.

Unfortunately, the offline logic is mostly broken and some gamemodes might not work correctly.
